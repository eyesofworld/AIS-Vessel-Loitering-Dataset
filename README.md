# AIS Vessel Loitering Dataset

## Datasets
This dataset is constructed from real-world AIS data, specifically designed for vessel loitering detection and behavior analysis. It comprises 8,111,660 AIS data points covering 5,155 unique vessels, organized into 21,228 individual trajectories. Distinct from simple trajectory classification datasets, this dataset provides fine-grained annotations at the data-point level.
