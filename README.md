# From Trajectory Classification to Activity Localization: A Transformer-Based Approach for Vessel Loitering Behavior Analysis

## Paper Overview
Vessel loitering detection is crucial for maritime surveillance by identifying anomalous behavior. Existing methods mainly focus on holistic AIS data trajectory classification, which falls short in accurately pinpointing specific loitering segments within the voyage. In this study, we reframe loitering detection as a sequence-labeling task, enabling precise point-wise predictions along trajectories for fine-grained activity localization.

## Datasets
This dataset is constructed from real-world AIS data, specifically designed for vessel loitering detection and behavior analysis. It comprises 8,111,660 AIS data points covering 5,155 unique vessels, organized into 21,228 individual trajectories. Distinct from simple trajectory classification datasets, this dataset provides fine-grained annotations at the data-point level.
